  title={Radiative cooling with sky-facing surfaces},
  author={Eden Rephaeli and Shanhui Fan},
  journal={Optics Express},
  volume={22},

  abstract={This paper explores the concept of passive radiative cooling using surfaces that face the sky. It focuses on the design and implementation of materials and structures that are highly reflective in the solar spectrum and highly emissive in the thermal infrared spectrum, particularly within the atmospheric window of 8 to 13 micrometers. By doing so, these materials can effectively dissipate heat in the form of infrared radiation, passing through the atmosphere and reaching the cold outer space, thus achieving cooling below ambient air temperature without energy consumption.}

   abstract = {When consulting with the Marconi company in 1995, Prof. Sir John Pendry uncovered exotic structures that gave negative permittivity and negative permeability, respectively. In 1999, Prof. Pendry introduced split ring resonators (SRRs), and later in 2000, Prof. David Smith and Prof. Sheldon Schultz experimentally showed that periodic array of SRRs and continuous wires previously proposed by Prof. Pendry could exhibit simultaneously negative values of effective permeability and permittivity at the same frequency. Shortly after, Prof. Pendry revealed that a slab of material with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability could challenge the Abbé diffraction limit on traditional lenses and focus all Fourier components of a point object onto a perfect image, leading to a “perfect lens”. The vision of a perfect lens attracted extensive research interest and opened a new field which was later widely known as metamaterials. Now two decades on, the explosion of metamaterials has revolutionized numerous researches in physics, materials science, chemistry, and engineering. To shed light on the research direction of metamaterials, Light: Science & Applications invited Sir John Pendry, father and living legend of metamaterials, to speak about the future of metamaterials.

abstract = {Repeated sputtering and annealing are standard preparation methods for obtaining a stoichiometric TiO2(1 1 0) surface for surface science experiments. However, both processes result in a reduction in TiO2 crystal when used separately, leading to the modification of the physical and chemical properties of oxide materials. Our investigation aims to determine how these two processes affect the electronic properties of the surface and subsurface regions at the nanometer scale. To accomplish this goal, we utilized local microscopy (Kelvin probe force microscopy and local-conductivity atomic force microscopy) and spectroscopy methods (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry). We found that repeated sputtering and annealing does, in fact, affect both the conductivity and work function of the surface. The work function, as well as conductivity, increase with increasing number of cycles, but then reach a plateau. Furthermore, we show that the way the surface is prepared, using multiple cycles or one cycle of equivalent ion-beam fluence, matters. We attribute the differences in the crystal properties to the dynamics of stoichiometric changes during sputtering and subsequent annealing which we illustrate using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, which shows that after multiple cycles the subsurface layer is modified, even though XPS shows a stoichiometric surface.},

   abstract = {High temperature stable selective emitters can significantly increase efficiency and radiative power in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems. However, optical properties of structured emitters reported so far degrade at temperatures approaching 1200 °C due to various degradation mechanisms. We have realized a 1D structured emitter based on a sputtered W-HfO 2 layered metamaterial and demonstrated desired band edge spectral properties at 1400 °C. To the best of our knowledge the temperature of 1400 °C is the highest reported for a structured emitter, so far. The spatial confinement and absence of edges stabilizes the W-HfO 2 multilayer system to temperatures unprecedented for other nanoscaled W-structures. Only when this confinement is broken W starts to show the well-known self-diffusion behavior transforming to spherical shaped W-islands. We further show that the oxidation of W by atmospheric oxygen could be prevented by reducing the vacuum pressure below 10 −5 mbar. When oxidation is mitigated we observe that the 20 nm spatially confined W films survive temperatures up to 1400 °C. The demonstrated thermal stability is limited by grain growth in HfO 2 , which leads to a rupture of the W-layers, thus, to a degradation of the multilayer system at 1450 °C.},

   abstract = {Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is the process by which photons radiated from a thermal emitter are converted into electrical power via a photovoltaic cell. Selective thermal emitters that can survive at temperatures at or above ∼1000°C have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy conversion by restricting the emission of photons with energies below the photovoltaic (PV) cell bandgap energy. In this work, we demonstrated TPV energy conversion using a high-temperature selective emitter, dielectric filter, and 0.6 eV In0.68Ga0.32As photovoltaic cell. We fabricated a passivated platinum and alumina frequency-selective surface by conventional stepper lithography. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of TPV energy conversion using a metamaterial emitter. The emitter was heated to >1000°C, and converted electrical power was measured. After accounting for geometry, we demonstrated a thermal-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 24.1?0.9%at 1055°C. We separately modeled our system con- sisting of a selective emitter, dielectric filter, and PV cell and found agreement with our measured efficiency and power to within 1%. Our results indicate that high-efficiency TPV generators are possible and are candidates for remote power generation, combined heat and power, and heat-scavenging applications},

We theoretically demonstrate a novel, efficient and cost effective thermal emitter using a Mie-resonance metamaterial for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) applications. We propose for the first time the design of a thermal emitter which is based on nanoparticle-embedded thin film. The emitter consists of a thin film of SiO 2 on the top of tungsten layer deposited on a substrate. The thin film is embedded with tungsten nanoparticles which alter the refractive index of the film. This gives rise to desired emissive properties in the wavelength range of 0.4 μm to 2 μm suitable for GaSb and InGaAs based photovoltaics. Effective dielectric properties are calculated using Maxwell-Garnett-Mie theory. Our calculations indicate this would significantly improve the efficiency of TPV cells.

To improve the efficiency of TPV systems, wavelength-selective emitters are designed to take thermal energy from various heat sources and then emit photons to the TPV cells. A two-dimensional grating/thin-film nanostructure is proposed as an efficient emitter, whose performance is enhanced by the excitations of both surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and magnetic polaritons (MPs). Rigorous coupled-wave analysis is used to predict the emittance as well as the electromagnetic field and current density distributions. The normal emittance of the proposed nanostructure is shown to be wavelength-selective and polarization-insensitive. The mechanisms of SPP and MP excitations in the nanostructure are elucidated for different polarizations. The current-density loop further confirms the existence of magnetic resonances. Furthermore, the effect of azimuthal and polar angles on the emittance spectra is also investigated, suggesting that the proposed structure has high emittance not only in the normal direction but also at large oblique angles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The SANTE film concept is based on integrating broad-band solar radiation absorption with selective narrow-band thermal IR radiation which can be efficiently coupled to a photovoltaic (PV) cell for power generation. By employing a low reflectivity refractory metal (e.g., tungsten) as a plasmonic material, we demonstrate that the absorption spectrum of the SANTE film can be designed to be broad-band in the visible range and narrow-band in the infrared range. A detailed balance calculation demonstrates that the total STPV system efficiency exceeds the Shockley-Queisser limit for emitter temperatures above Te = 1200K, and achieves an efficiency as high as 41% for T e = 2300K. Emitter temperatures in this range are shown to be achievable under modest sun concentrations (less than 1000 suns) due to the thermal insulation provided by the SANTE film. An experimental demonstration of the wide-angle, frequency-selective absorptivity is presented. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Specifically, by controlling the helicity of the input light, the positive and negative polarity are interchangeable in one identical flat lens. Helicity-controllable real and virtual focal planes, as well as magnified and demagnified imaging, are observed on the same plasmonic lens at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.

Ideal invisibility devices are impossible, owing to the wave nature of light. This study develops a general recipe for the design of media that create perfect invisibility within the accuracy of geometrical optics. The imperfections of invisibility can be made arbitrarily small to hide objects that are much larger than the wavelength. With the use of modern metamaterials, practical demonstrations of such devices may be possible.

   abstract = {We discuss the validity of standard retrieval methods that assign bulk electromagnetic properties, such as the electric permittivity ε and the magnetic permeability μ, from calculations of the scattering (S) parameters for finite-thickness samples. S-parameter retrieval methods have recently become the principal means of characterizing artificially structured metamaterials, which, by nature, are inherently inhomogeneous. While the unit cell of a metamaterial can be made considerably smaller than the free space wavelength, there remains a significant variation of the phase across the unit cell at operational frequencies in nearly all metamaterial structures reported to date. In this respect, metamaterials do not rigorously satisfy an effective medium limit and are closer conceptually to photonic crystals. Nevertheless, we show here that a modification of the standard S-parameter retrieval procedure yields physically reasonable values for the retrieved electromagnetic parameters, even when there is significant inhomogeneity within the unit cell of the structure. We thus distinguish a metamaterial regime, as opposed to the effective medium or photonic crystal regimes, in which a refractive index can be rigorously established but where the wave impedance can only be approximately defined. We present numerical simulations on typical metamaterial structures to illustrate the modified retrieval algorithm and the impact on the retrieved material parameters. We find that no changes to the standard retrieval procedures are necessary when the inhomogeneous unit cell is symmetric along the propagation axis; however, when the unit cell does not possess this symmetry, a modified procedure - in which a periodic structure is assumed - is required to obtain meaningful electromagnetic material parameters. ©2005 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {This standard is issued under the fixed designation D 5568; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 1. Scope 1.1 This test method covers a procedure for determining relative complex permittivity (relative dielectric constant and loss index) and relative magnetic permeability of isotropic, reciprocal (nongyromagnetic) solid materials. If the material is nonmagnetic, this procedure may be used to measure permit-tivity only. 1.2 This measurement method is valid over a frequency range of approximately 1 MHz to 50 GHz. These limits are not exact and depend on the size of the specimen, the size and type of transmission line used as a specimen holder, and on the applicable frequency range of the network analyzer used to make measurements. The lower frequency is limited by the smallest measurable phase shift through a specimen, and the upper frequency limit is determined by the excitation of higher-order modes that invalidates the dominant-mode transmission line model. Any number of discrete measurement frequencies may be selected in this frequency range. To achieve maximum measurement accuracy, use of different transmission line sizes and types may be required. For example , use of a 7-mm diameter coaxial geometry can provide for measurements from 1 MHz to 18 GHz. However, air gaps that exist between the specimen and the transmission line's conductors introduce errors 2 that may necessitate the use of a larger diameter coaxial transmission line and a series of rectangular wave guides of different size to cover this frequency range. 1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only. 1.4 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 2. Referenced Documents 2.1 ASTM Standards: D 1711 Terminology Relating to Electrical Insulation 3 3. Terminology 3.1 For other definitions used in this test method, refer to Terminology D 1711. 3.2 Definitions: 3.2.1 relative complex permittivity (relative complex dielec-tric constant) (relative complex capacitivity), e R , n-the ratio of the admittance of a given configuration of the material to the admittance of the same configuration with vacuum as dielec-tric: e* R 5 Y Y y 5 Y jvCy 5 e8 R 2 je9 R , (1) where Y is the admittance with the material and jvC8y is the admittance with vacuum. 3.2.1.1 Discussion-In common usage the word "relative" is frequently dropped. The real part of complex relative permittivity (e8 R) is often referred to as simply relative permit-tivity, permittivity or dielectric constant. The imaginary part of complex relative permittivity (e9 R) is often referred to as the loss index. In anisotropic media, permittivity is described by a three dimensional tensor. 3.2.2 For the purposes of this test method, the media is considered to be isotropic, and therefore permittivity is a single complex number. 3.3 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 3.3.1 A list of symbols specific to this test method is given in Annex A1. 3.3.2 calibration, n-a procedure for connecting characterized standard devices to the test ports of a network analyzer to characterize the measurement system's systematic errors. The effects of the systematic errors are then mathematically removed from the indicated measurements. The calibration also establishes the mathematical reference plane for the measurement test ports. 3.3.2.1 Discussion-Modern network analyzers have this capability built in.

Here, the fabrication of noble-metal-free reconfigurable HMMs for visible photonic applications is experimentally demonstrated. The low-loss and active HMMs are realized by combining titanium nitride (TiN) and stibnite (Sb2S3) as the phase change material. A reconfigurable plasmonic biosensor platform based on active Sb2S3–TiN HMMs is proposed, and it is shown that significant improvement in sensitivity is possible for small molecule detection at low concentrations. In addition, a plasmonic apta-biosensor based on a hybrid platform of graphene and Sb2S3–TiN HMM is developed and the detection and real-time binding of thrombin concentration as low as 1 × 10−15 m are demonstrated.

Such phase-change materials are of enormous interest in the fields of plasmonics and nanophotonics. However, in such applications, the fact that some chalcogenides accrue plasmonic properties in the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline state, i.e., the real part of their relative permittivity becomes negative, has gone somewhat unnoticed. Indeed, one of the most commercially important chalcogenide compounds, germanium antimony telluride (Ge2:Sb2:Te5 or GST), which is widely used in rewritable optical and electronic data storage technologies, presents this behavior at wavelengths in the near-ultraviolet to visible spectral range. In this work, we show that the phase transition-induced emergence of plasmonic properties in the crystalline state can markedly change the optical properties of sub-wavelength-thickness, nanostructured GST films, allowing for the realization of non-volatile, reconfigurable (e.g., color-tunable) chalcogenide metasurfaces operating at visible frequencies and creating opportunities for developments in non-volatile optical memory, solid state displays and all-optical switching devices.},

This review first examines the issues, difficulties and challenges in prediction of material behaviors by summarizing and critiquing the existing major analytical approaches dealing with material property modeling. The focus then shifts to some recent advances in numerical methodology that are able to predict more accurately and efficiently the effective physical properties of multiphase materials with complex internal microstructures. A random generation-growth algorithm is highlighted for reproducing multiphase microstructures, statistically equivalent to the actual systems, based on the geometrical and morphological information obtained from measurements and experimental estimations. Then a high-efficiency lattice Boltzmann solver for the corresponding governing equations is described which, while assuring energy conservation and the appropriate continuities at numerous interfaces in a complex system, has demonstrated its numerical power in yielding accurate solutions. Various applications are provided to validate the feasibility, effectiveness and robustness of this new methodology by comparing the predictions with existing experimental data from different transport processes, accounting for the effects due to component size, material anisotropy, internal morphology and multiphase interactions. The examples given also suggest even wider potential applicability of this methodology to other problems as long as they are governed by the similar partial differential equation(s). Thus, for given system composition and structure, this numerical methodology is in essence a model built on sound physics principles with prior validity, without resorting to ad hoc empirical treatment. Therefore, it is useful for design and optimization of new materials, beyond just predicting and analyzing the existing ones. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Evidence of the emergent attenuation zone is provided by direct numerical simulations as well as semianalytical developments via the method of multiple scales. The analyses demonstrate that, in the considered nonlinear locally resonant metamaterial, the combined effects of autoparametric and local resonance induce saturation of the primary wave at certain conditions and, subsequently, promote energy exchange from a primary propagating wave to an evanescent subharmonic wave, giving rise to an additional attenuation zone.

   abstract = {Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is an inexpensive material that has the potential to dominate the next-generation photovoltaic (PV) industry. Here we detail computational investigation of CIGS solar cell with encouragement of adopting cuprous dioxide (Cu2O) as a Hole Transport Layer (HTL) for efficient fabricated CIGS solar cells. Although Cu2O as a HTL has been studied earlier for perovskite and other organic/inorganic solar cell yet no study has been detailed on potential application of Cu2O for CIGS solar cells. With the proposed architecture, recombination losses are fairly reduced at the back contact and contribute to enhanced photo-current generation. With the introduction of Cu2O, the overall cell efficiency is increased to 26.63%. The wide-band of Cu2O pulls holes from the CIGS absorber which allows smoother extraction of holes with experiencing lesser resistance. Further, it was also inferred that, HTL also improves the quantum efficiency (QE) for photons with large wavelengths thus increases the cell operating spectrum.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a model of the Cu2O solar cell with double electron transport layers (ETLs) and a hole transport layer (HTL) has been investigated by SCAPS. Compared to the single ETL of ZnO, the problem of low open circuit voltage of the Cu2O solar cells can be improved by introducing the double ETLs of Zn(O,S)/ZnS. Our simulation results show that the sulfur concentration of Zn(O,S) and the donor density in double ETLs have a significant effect on device performance. The optimum S/S + O ratio and the best donor density are 0.82 and 8 × 1017cm−3, respectively. Due to the formation of an electron reflector and back surface field (BSF), an enhancement in both short circuit current density and open circuit voltage can be realized by introducing an appropriate HTL, and the best HTL is CuI, showing an efficiency of 12.15%. Then, the work function of metal electrode, the Cu2O thickness, the defect density and the acceptor density of Cu2O absorber layer, and the defect density at the Cu2O interfaces have been systematically investigated. After optimization, the best device efficiency of 16.49% can be achieved. Our results have demonstrated a new high-efficiency structure for cuprous oxide solar cells.},

But the performance of TCT configuration is affected under shading conditions, resulting in multiple peaks occurring in the output PV characteristics. To improve the performance of TCT array configuration under different shading scenarios, it is only necessary to reposition or rearrange the PV modules in the TCT Solar PV array based on the arrangement of puzzle numbers, without altering the electrical contacts of the TCT array configuration. The main objective of this study is to investigate the performance of rearrangement of modules in SPV array based new TCT array configurations with shade dispersion technique and compare the global maximum peak power (GMPP) of SPV array, mismatch losses, Fill-Factor, efficiency and number of required electrical connections or ties between array modules with proposed optimal arrangement of modules under shading (non-uniform irradiance) conditions. For this study, one uniform irradiance case and total 14 partial shading patterns were considered.

Since the first demonstration of 29% efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000 °C (ref. 10), TPV fabrication and performance have improved11,12. However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50% (refs. 11,13,14), the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 °C (refs. 13–15). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are two-junction devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900–2,400 °C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid.},

Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on samples of type (i) is used to characterize the nonlinear response of metamaterials in dependence of the photon energy and the size, shape, and symmetry of the nanoscopic building blocks constituting the metamaterials. We find a complex dependence of the SHG spectra on the design parameters that requires an in-depth theoretical analysis. SHG is applied to samples of type (ii) to enhance the nonlinear optical performance of functional materials by writing a metamaterial acting as optical catalyst on top. We observe an enhancement of the SHG signal induced by the ferroelectric order of the RMnO 3 crystals, yet with pronounced variations between samples. Measurements of both types, (i) and (ii), show that a comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear optical properties of metamaterials requires one to go beyond a macroscopic symmetry treatment.

The elements shape impact on the bandwidth and electric field enhancement. The hyperbolic absorber shows 107% bandwidth which is covering 300–1100 nm and this technique can increase the bandwidth by more than 80%. In addition, as shown in this study, the hyperbolic structure can be underscored for increasing the electric and magnetic field by more than 1 dB, and thus this absorber can be used to intensity the power density to achieve higher efficiency. Finally, the nanosphere is implemented in the dielectric layer of the hyperbolic metamaterial structure to enhance the absorption of the solar cell. The P3HT is investigated as the proposed substrate for the active layer. Moreover, the spacer material can impact the reflection and the SiN layer shows the best bandwidth and reflection.

Here, we report the fabrication, the characterization, and the principle of operation of gold nanorod hyperbolic metamaterials (NHMMs) along with ultrasensitive bulk refractive index and label-free biomolecular detection. By combining electron-beam lithography and nanoscale electroplating, we demonstrate the fabrication of a highly ordered, height-controllable, and vertical array of nanorods. By exciting the bulk plasmon–polariton mode in the NHMM using a prism-coupling technique and integrating the sensor in microfluidics, we demonstrate that the bulk sensitivity and figure of merit of our device could reach 41,600 nm/RIU and 416 RIU -1 , respectively. The physical mechanism of this high bulk sensitivity is revealed through theoretical and experimental studies. Moreover, by bio-functionalizing the surface of the NHMM sensor, monitoring the binding of streptavidin at dilute concentrations is performed in real time. We test different concentrations of streptavidin ranging from 200 to 5 µg/mL, and the NHMM biosensor exhibits a 1 nm wavelength shift for a 5 µg/mL streptavidin detection. By fitting the Hill equation of the NHMM biosensor and taking into account the level of noise (0.05 nm) as the minimum wavelength shift of the detectable limit, the limit of detection of the NHMM biosensor to streptavidin can be estimated to be 0.14 µg/mL (2.4 nm). As a direct comparison, a 0.5 nm wavelength shift for 20 µg/mL of streptavidin is reported when using a conventional gold film sensor under identical experimental conditions. The developed plasmonic NHMM sensor shows tremendous potential for highly sensitive bulk solutions and biomolecule detection and provides a promising avenue for free-label biosensing applications in the future. },

Thus, incorporating responsive materials such as semiconductors, liquid crystals, phase-change materials, or quantum materials (e.g., superconductors, 2D materials, etc.) imbue metamaterials with dynamic properties, facilitating the development of active and tunable devices harboring enhanced or even entirely novel electromagnetic functionality. Ultimately, active control derives from the ability to craft the local electromagnetic fields; accomplished using a host of external stimuli to modify the electronic or optical properties of the responsive materials embedded into the active regions of the subwavelength resonators. We provide a broad overview of this frontier area of metamaterials research, introducing fundamental concepts and presenting control strategies that include electronic, optical, mechanical, thermal, and magnetic stimuli. The examples presented range from microwave to visible wavelengths, utilizing a wide range of materials to realize spatial light modulators, effective nonlinear media, on-demand optics, and polarimetric imaging as but a few examples.

Recently many new approaches based upon deep learning have arisen, generating promising results. We conceptualize these models as different schemes for efficiently, but randomly, exploring the space of possible inverse solutions. As a result, the accuracy of each approach should be evaluated as a function of time rather than a single estimated solution, as is often done now. Using this metric, we compare several state-of-the-art inverse modeling approaches on four benchmark tasks: two existing tasks, a new 2-dimensional sinusoid task, and a challenging modern task of meta-material design. Finally, inspired by our conception of the inverse problem, we explore a simple solution that uses a deep neural network as a surrogate (i.e., approximation) for the forward model, and then uses backpropagation with respect to the model input to search for good inverse solutions. Variations of this approach-which we term the neural adjoint (NA)-have been explored recently on specific problems, and here we evaluate it comprehensively on our benchmark. We find that the addition of a simple novel loss term-which we term the boundary loss-dramatically improves the NA's performance, and it consequentially achieves the best (or nearly best) performance in all of our benchmark scenarios.},

   abstract = {Group theoretical methods are used to determine the electromagnetic properties of artificial magnetic meta-materials, based solely upon the symmetries of the underlying constituent particles. Point groups for such materials are determined. From the transformation properties of an electromagnetic (EM) basis under symmetries of the particles, it is possible to determine, (i) the EM modes of the particles, (ii) the form of constitutive relations (iii) magneto-optical response of a meta-material or lack thereof. These methods are shown to be useful for determination of the isotropic or bi-anisotropic nature of artificial magnetic particles. The results for several artificial magnetic metamaterials are given. Based upon these methods, we predict an ideal planar artificial meta-material, which eliminates an undesirable electric resonance while still exhibiting a magnetic response. Further we determine the subset of point groups of which particles must belong to in order to yield an isotropic 3D magnetic response, and we show an example. Progress in the rapidly advancing field of metamate-rials has experienced even further growth due to the recent observation of a negative index (NI) medium.[1] A NI medium is an artificial material in which both the magnetic µ and electric ǫ response obtain simultaneous negative values, thus yielding a negative index of refrac-tion. Although predicted over three decades ago,[2] it wasn't until recently that such materials were realized. Typically NI media utilize individual components for the electric and magnetic response. Materials which exhibited negative epsilon, known as artificial dielectrics, have been known since the 40's.[3, 4, 5] The critical component responsible for the demonstration of NI was the realization that artificial non-magnetic materials could be constructed to exhibit negative response.[6] The first demonstrations of NI materials were performed at microwave frequencies, due in part to the ease of fabrication as well as simplicity of measurements. [1, 7] The magnetic component of NI materials have since been demonstrated at lower RF[8] frequencies and higher THz[9] frequencies. Great interest for the further extension of these exotic materials to optical frequencies (uti-lizing nano-sized elements) is fuelling massive research efforts. Given the potential of NI materials to span the electromagnetic spectrum, it is important to understand their full complex electromagnetic behavior. In particular , the structures utilized for NI are bianisotropic and may yield rich electromagnetic properties such as chiral-ity κ and/or non-reciprocity χ. At microwave frequencies where complex reflection and transmission measurements (S-parameter) are common, it is difficult to characterize bianisotropic materials. This difficulty stems from the fact that these materials are necessarily described by the most general form of the con-stitutive relations. There may be 36 complex quantities to determine, and thus standard complex reflection and transmission measurements yield incomplete EM information. At THz and higher frequencies where phase sensitive measurements are not common it is even more difficult , although methods such as ellipsometry or THz time domain spectroscopy may prove useful. Further since a magnetic and electric resonant response enter similarly into the Fresnel equations, it is difficult to determine the origin of the response. Typically, artificial magnetic metamaterials are constructed from conducting elements, and thus a full electromagnetic characterization is a necessity , since an electric response is unavoidable. Analytical theories have yielded equations able to predict the resonant frequency ω 0 and plasma frequency ω p of metamaterials. However there is a lack of suitable analytical methods capable of determining the many varying and complicated EM properties. Simulation is still heavily relied upon and, as of yet, is still unable to determine and distinguishing bianisotropic response. We present a group theoretical method capable of determining various electromagnetic properties for magnetic metamaterials. This method is based simply upon the symmetry operations of the constituent particles about a point in space, i.e. point group theory. An EM basis is assigned to the artificial particle under investigation , and transformations of this basis under the symmetries of the group yield the electromagnetic modes. This new method allows one to calculate: the EM modes, the form of the constitutive relations, and the determine wether a particle will exhibit magneto-optical response. This approach is demonstrated by way of an example. Materials utilized for negative magnetic response have been shown to be bianisotropic,[10] thus let us review the constitutive relations for these materials, which can be written as:[11] D B =   ǫ ξ ζ µ   E H (1) In Eq.1 the permittivities within the 2x2 matrix are tensors of second rank, also called dyadics. The terms ξ and ζ are called the magneto-optical permittivities,},

While dynamic response is highly desired, metamaterials are usually passive and cannot be tuned post-fabrication. A conventional active metamaterial consists of rigid resonators mounted on flexible substrates that permit a limited amount of mechanical tuning. Given that rigid resonators permanently deform or debond under large strains (above 30%), the range of flexibility that is possible with tunable metamaterials is limited. Here, we propose a kirigami-inspired geometry that overcomes this limitation. The proposed design enhances stretchability exceeding 100% when compared with the existing design. A high degree of flexibility is achieved through “stress engineering” at the interface between rigid resonators and flexible substrates. Our design shows that the resonance modes shift at a rate of 3.32 ± 0.1 nm for every 1% change in strain, which is the highest tunability reported thus far. We demonstrate how this new concept can be applied to structural color. Using a single design, we demonstrated the full range of colors for the first time.

   abstract = {This report details a deep learning approach to the forward and inverse designs of plasmonic metasurface structural color. Here, optimized Deep Neural Network models are presented to enable the forward and inverse mapping between metamaterial structure and corresponding color. The forward model is capable of predicting color with >96% accuracy, with a 105 order of magnitude decrease in computational time when compared to finite-difference time-domain simulations used in conventional design workflows. An inverse model is trained using a tandem autoencoder, employing the pre-trained forward model. Here, the use of synthetic training data for self-learning is reported, which results in an ≈15% improvement in training accuracy. The tightly constrained inverse model allows for the instantaneous design of metasurfaces, given a desired color, with an accuracy of >86%, making it suitable for commercial use as well as the acceleration of photonics research.},

   abstract = {In this work, a graphene-dielectric multilayer hyperbolic metamaterial (GHMM) has been analyzed for the generation of THz Cherenkov radiation (CR) from graphene surface plasmonics (GSP), induced by a moving electron bunch. The structure under analysis consists of a graphene-dielectric multilayer HMM in which the top graphene layer is considered as an interface between air and the underlying multilayer as the substrate. The dispersion analysis of the structure shows the existence of bulk-HMM (BH) and non-bulk HMM (NBH)-region in the ω–k space. The structure is found to generate intense CR from the GSP, when the operating point of the electron bunch lies in the BH-region, as the bulk states of the HMM substrate allows the efficient transformation of high-k GSP into THz-CR. The proposed structure can be exploited as a potential candidate for the development of low-voltage, electron beam-driven, ultra-tunable, compact graphene plasmonic Cherenkov THz radiation source. Moreover, the application of the principle of utilizing bulk states of HMM for CR generation has also been discussed for black phosphorous (BP), an emerging 2Dmaterial for the THz to infrared (IR) region.},

   abstract = {The solar cell with wider bandwidth is interesting more than the narrowband structure. Thus, the non-homogenous structure can be used to increase the bandwidth and absorption ratio. In addition, trapping more energy is an important factor for solar cells. Therefore, the hyperbolic metamaterial is developed to provide a non-homogeneous structure. The elements shape impact on the bandwidth and electric field enhancement. The hyperbolic absorber shows 107% bandwidth which is covering 300–1100 nm and this technique can increase the bandwidth by more than 80%. In addition, as shown in this study, the hyperbolic structure can be underscored for increasing the electric and magnetic field by more than 1 dB, and thus this absorber can be used to intensity the power density to achieve higher efficiency. Finally, the nanosphere is implemented in the dielectric layer of the hyperbolic metamaterial structure to enhance the absorption of the solar cell. The P3HT is investigated as the proposed substrate for the active layer. Moreover, the spacer material can impact the reflection and the SiN layer shows the best bandwidth and reflection. This study reveals that the heterojunction structure can be supposed as a solution with hyperbolic metamaterial for plasmonic solar cells.},

   abstract = {Demand for an antenna with high gain and directivity for medical sensing is necessary so the Vivaldi antenna in the THz spectrum with reconfigurable characteristics is a proper solution. Antenna design with a higher gain and bandwidth can be a remarkable choice for THz sensing. Thus, in this work, a Vivaldi antenna is developed for 0.5 to 2 THz with more than 120% bandwidth. To obtain the reconfigurable characteristics, the graphene slabs can be used for this type of antenna to improve the bandwidth when the chemical potential is changed from 0.1 to 0.7 eV. Using the graphene slabs can affect both the gain and return loss of the antenna. Therefore, to modify the return loss, the graphene plasmonic nano-ribbons are used and silicon slabs are improvised between the graphene to reduce its drawback by providing a hyperbolic metamaterial lens. The hyperbolic metamaterial lens can concentrate the electric field to compensate for the graphene loss. The final antenna gain is increased up to 11.5 dBi, which makes it attractive for biosensing. This antenna is used for recognizing the cancerous and healthy skin tissue in the THz spectrum.},

This plasmon induced tunable metasurface works based on multiband super-absorption in the infrared frequency regime. It consists of a metal mirror that facilitates the MM to work as an absorber where the metal pattern at the top layer creates an enhanced evanescent wave that facilitates the metasurface to work as a RI optical sensor. The modelling and numerical analysis are carried out using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method-based software, CST microwave studio where a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the geometric parameters. We demonstrate multiband super-absorption spectra having maximum absorption of more than 99%. Furthermore, we show how the multiband super-absorber nanostructure can be used as a RI NBS, where the resonance frequency shifts with the RI of the surrounding medium. The achieved opto-chemical sensitivity is approximately 65it nm/it RIU~it RIU , the bio-optical sensitivity to detect viruses is approximately 76 nm / RIU; and the optical sensitivity of the water-soluble glucose concentration is about 300it nm/ it RIU ; all sensitivities are comparable in comparison with the reported values in the literature.},

Diffractive optical elements (DOE) are used for diffracting laser beams to form conductive FSS images on the VO2 wafer for frequency selectivity. The dipoles on the VO2 wafer generate a stop band response of 12 dB and 10 dB for unit cells of the single dipole and double dipole at 3.5 GHz, respectively.

Here, we have designed an ultra-broadband light absorber by integrating two differentsized tapered hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) waveguides, each of which has wide but different absorption bands due to broadband slow-light response, into a unit cell. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that in such a design strategy, the low absorption bands between high absorption bands with a single-sized tapered HMM waveguide array can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a largely expanded absorption bandwidth ranging from 2.3 to 40 GHz. The presented ultra-broadband light absorber is also insensitive to polarization and robust against incident angle. Our results offer a further step in developing practical artificial electromagnetic absorbers, which will impact a broad range of applications at microwave frequencies.},

Its absorption characteristics were insensitive to the polarization angle and a wide range of incidence angles, making it an ideal absorber. Further investigations of the electric field, magnetic field, and surface current distributions were carried out to elaborate on the absorption characteristics at various resonance frequencies. The proposed device can also be used as a sensor that can detect the depth of the surrounding analyte and its refractive index. The device could detect the depth of the analyte with a peak sensitivity of 2.76 THz µm−1 and its refractive index with a peak sensitivity of 1.55 THz RIU−1.

The top metallic patch, placed across the edges of the 0.58 mm thickness Rogers RO4003C (lossy) substrate, forms the bulk of the projected absorber’s ultra-thin layer. Nonetheless, absorption is exceedingly strong, covering C-band, X-band and K-band and reaching levels of 97.8%, 99.9%, and 99.9%, respectively, under normal and even oblique (0° to 45°) incident conditions. In chosen ranges of frequency of 6.24, 10.608, and 18.624 GHz for both TM and TE mode, the displayed Q-factors were 62.4, 17.68, and 26.61, respectively. We correspondingly calculated the RAB (relative absorption bandwidth) to evaluate absorption performance. An equivalent circuit proved its performance capabilities, indicating that it would produce a high-quality MMA from ADS software. Furthermore, the absorber’s performance has been verified in free space on a sample being tested using a different array of unit cells. Moreover, the proposed structures with HFSS simulators to display the MMA’s absolute absorption at each absorption peak are somewhat inconsistent with the results of the CST simulator. Because of its superior performance, the ultra-thin absorber is suited for a wide range of applications, including satellite applications such as radar systems, stealth technology, imaging, and electromagnetic interference reduction.},

The simulation results show that the terahertz (THz) absorption bandwidth of more than 90% absorptance reaches 3.30 THz, which covers from 2.34 to 5.64 THz, under different incident polarization angles. The range is better than that of previous VO 2 -based reports. Moreover, when the conductivity of VO 2 changes from 200 S/m to 2×10 5 S/m, the absorption peak intensity can be adjusted continuously from 4% to 100%. The key is to optimize the geometric structure through interference cancellation and impedance matching theory, to achieve better absorption bandwidth and efficiency. Besides, the terahertz absorber has a wide-angle absorption effect both in TE and TM waves. Thus, the designed absorber may have many potential applications in modulating, sensing and imaging technology. },
